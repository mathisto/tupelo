= Tupelo Forest - One Tree To Rule Them All

== Overview

Have you ever wanted to manipulate tree-like data structures such as hiccup or HTML?
If so, then the `tupelo.forest` library is for you!  Forest allows you to:

- Easily search for tree nodes based on the path from the tree root
- Search for tree nodes based on content
- Limit a search to nodes in an arbitrary sub-tree
- Find parents and siblings of a node found in a search
- Chain searches together, so that nodes found in one search are used to limit
  the scope of sub-searches

In addition, `tupelo.forest` allows you to update the tree by adding, changing, or deleting nodes.
Since `tupelo.forest` allows one to easily find parent and/or sibling nodes, this is a powerful feature
missing in most other tree-processing libraries.

== Quick Start

Create a tree using Hiccup:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns xyz
  (:use tupelo.core tupelo.forest))

(with-forest (new-forest)
  (let [root-hid (add-tree-hiccup [:a
                                   [:b 1]
                                   [:b 2]
                                   [:b
                                    [:c 4]
                                    [:c 5]]
                                   [:c 9]])]
----

Display the tree in a compact format:

[source,clojure]
----
(is= (format-paths (find-paths root-hid [:a]))
  [[{:tag :a}
    [{:tag :b, :value 1}]
    [{:tag :b, :value 2}]
    [{:tag :b}
     [{:tag :c, :value 4}]
     [{:tag :c, :value 5}]]
    [{:tag :c, :value 9}]]])
----

Display the paths from the root to all `:c` nodes:

[source,clojure]
----
(let [c-paths (find-paths root-hid [:** :c]) ]
  (is= c-paths [[:0006 :0004 :0002]
                [:0006 :0004 :0003]
                [:0006 :0005]])
----

Each value like `:0004` is a Hexidecimal ID (HID) that serves as a pointer to a tree node like `[:c 9]`.
Each vector of HIDs is a path from the root node `:a` to a `:c` node.  There are three `:c` nodes and, hence,
three paths. You can see that the length of each of the 3 paths matches the position in the
tree of the 3 `:c` nodes. Each `:c` node is at the end of its respective path.

Display the last `:c` node as Hiccup:

[source,clojure]
----
(is= (hid->hiccup :0005) [:c 9] )
----

Find paths to all `[:c 4]` nodes. There is only one:

[source,clojure]
----
  (let [c4-paths (find-paths root-hid [:** {:tag :c :value 4}]) ]
    (is= c4-paths [[:0006 :0004 :0002]] ))
----

Find the parent of the `[:c 4]` node:

[source,clojure]
----
(let [c4-parent (-> c4-paths only reverse second)]
  (is= c4-parent :0004)
  (is= (hid->hiccup c4-parent)  [:b [:c 4] [:c 5]] )
  (is= (hid->node   c4-parent)  {:tag :b, :tupelo.forest/khids [:0002 :0003] } )
----

This shows the internal structure of tree nodes as simple maps. Node `:0004` has a `:tag` value of `:b` and 2 child
nodes (Kid HIDs \=> "khids").

Modify the value of the `[:c 4]` node:

[source,clojure]
----
(let [c4-hid (-> c4-paths only last)]
  (is= c4-hid :0002)
  (value-update c4-hid inc)
  (is= (hid->node c4-hid) {:tupelo.forest/khids [], :tag :c, :value 5}) )
----

== Creating a Tree

The easiest way to create a tree is by using Hiccup:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns xyz
  (:use tupelo.core tupelo.forest))

(with-forest (new-forest)
  (let [root-hid (add-tree-hiccup [:a
                                   [:b 1]
                                   [:b 2]
                                   [:b
                                    [:c 4]
                                    [:c 5]]
                                   [:c 9]])]
----

The expression `(with-forest ...)` defines a context for all contained expressions.
Here we create a new (empty) forest data-structure with `(new-forest)`.
The expression `(add-tree-hiccup ...)` inserts a tree (represented as hiccup data) into the forest,
returning the address of the tree root at `root-hid`. Each forest can contain many trees.

 - add-tree-enlive
 - add-tree-xml

=== What is an HID?

`tupelo.forest` uses an opaque value called an Hexadecimal ID (HID) as a pointer to each tree node.  An HID
is a Clojure keyword derived from the SHA-1 of a UUID and are 20 hex digits long (160 bits total).
Some typical HID values might be:

[source,code]
----
    :c3b0dccd4d344ac765183f49940f4d685de7a3f5
    :b40b6f37e6a746f815b092a8590cefe5cf37121a
    :c3b0dccd4d344ac765183f49940f4d685de7a3f5
    :76859beedd81468b4ee3cc5f17a5fdcf7a34a787
----

The HID format is designed so that each node will always have a unique ID value, without requireing coordination
with trees created in other locations or at other times.  Since 2^160 is approximately equal to the number of
atoms on Earth, we can be confident that no two tree nodes will ever have the same HID value.

==== Debugging with HIDs

At times, it may be easier to perform debugging or other tasks using short, deterministic HIDs.
In this case, you may use `(with-debug-hid ...)` to wrap an entire forest expression:

[source,clojure]
----
(with-debug-hid
  (with-forest (new-forest)
    ... ))
----

The `(with-debug-hid ...)` form will cause all HIDs to be limited to 4 hex digits (65536 values max).
The HIDs will also be created deterministically, counting up from `:0000`.  Some typical HIDs created
using `with-debug-hid` might be:


[source,clojure]
----
    :0000
    :0001
    :0002
    :0003
----

=== Displaying a Tree

- hid\->tree
- hid\->bush
- hid\->hiccup
- hid\->enlive

== Searching a Tree

- find-paths

=== What is a Path?

A path is nothing more than a vector of HIDs.  It describes tha path from one node to one of its descendant nodes.
Each node in the path is represented by its HID in the path vector.

==== Displaying a Path

- format-paths

==== Getting Node Information

- attribute(s)
- hid\->attr
- hid\->attrs
- hid\->bush
- hid\->enlive
- hid\->higgup
- hid\->kids
- hid\->leaf
- hid\->node
- hid\->tree

=== Manipulating a Tree

==== Adding Nodes

- node
- leaf
- tree

==== Modifying Child Nodes

- kids-append
- kids-prepend
- kids-set
- kids-update

==== Modifying Node Attributes

- get
- set
- remove
- update

=== Converting Between Formats

- bush
- enlive
- hiccup
- tree

=== Working with Sibling Nodes

Suppose we have some Hiccup nodes like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
  (with-debug-hid
    (with-forest (new-forest)
      (let [root-hid        (add-tree-hiccup
                              [:div {:class :some-div-1}
                               [:div {:class :some-div-2}
                                [:label "Some Junk"]
                                [:div {:class :some-div-3}
                                 [:label "Specify your shipping address"]
                                 [:div {:class :some-div-4}
                                  [:input {:type        "text" :autocomplete "off" :required "required"
                                           :placeholder "" :class "el-input__inner"}]]]]])
----

We want to find the `:input` node in the same `:div` as the `:label` node with text "Specify your shipping address".
We then find its parent, and use the parent as the beginning of a new search for the desired `:input` node:

[source,clojure]
----
label-path                   (only (find-paths root-hid [:** {:tag :label :value "Specify your shipping address"}]))
parent-div-hid               (-> label-path reverse second)
shipping-address-input-hid   (find-hid parent-div-hid [:div :div :input])
----

Unit test show it working:

[source,clojure]
----
(is= label-path [:0006 :0005 :0004 :0001])
(is= parent-div-hid :0004)
(is= (hid->hiccup shipping-address-input-hid)
  [:input {:type        "text", :autocomplete "off", :required "required",
           :placeholder "", :class "el-input__inner"}])
(value-set shipping-address-input-hid "1234 Main St")
(is= (hid->hiccup shipping-address-input-hid)
  [:input {:type         "text", :autocomplete "off", :required     "required",
           :placeholder  "", :class        "el-input__inner"}
   "1234 Main St"])
----

We can output the final modified tree:

[source,clojure]
----
(hid->hiccup root-hid) =>
    [:div
     {:class :some-div-1}
     [:div
      {:class :some-div-2}
      [:label "Some Junk"]
      [:div
       {:class :some-div-3}
       [:label "Specify your shipping address"]
       [:div
        {:class :some-div-4}
        [:input
         {:type "text",
          :autocomplete "off",
          :required "required",
          :placeholder "",
          :class "el-input__inner"}
         "1234 Main St"]]]]]
